# ðŸš¦ Real-Time Road Sign Detection using Deep Learning

This project is a part of an *Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)* designed to enhance road safety by detecting and classifying traffic signs in real time using deep learning techniques.

It utilizes *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* along with *OpenCV* for live video processing, helping autonomous vehicles or driver-assist systems make informed decisions.

A deep learning-based project that detects and classifies road signs in real-time using a live video stream. This model is designed to support autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems by recognizing traffic signs such as Stop, Yield, Speed Limits, and more.
